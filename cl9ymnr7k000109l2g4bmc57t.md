# What is Git? What is GitHub?

**Git** is a distributed version control system that helps to save versions of your code or project to a local database in your computer known as the git repository so that you can refer to any version of your code and it makes collaboration between developers easier and more effective. Distributed here means when git is used for collaboration between team members each team member can have a copy of the project on their system and still collaborate effectively.

Example:
Let's say you are building a calculator using python and you have really gone far into your project but then you realize you missed a step right from the beginning of your project then Git can come into play to help you recall the state of your project at the beginning. Or if you want to collaborate with other developers to build a project then Git can help to ensure every developer contributes without conflict.




**GitHub** is an online service where you can share your local git repository with other developers and also collaborate effectively.




So while Git saves changes locally on your computer, Github saves changes online.
